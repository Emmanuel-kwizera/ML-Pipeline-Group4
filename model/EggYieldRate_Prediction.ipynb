    "# Predicting Smallholder Poultry Productivity: A Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning and Deep Learning for Egg Yield Rate\n",

    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The core objective of this notebook is to develop and compare predictive models for the Monthly Egg Yield Rate (`s11q2_4/s11q2_3`). By accurately forecasting the productivity of laying hens, this work aims to establish data-driven benchmarks, enabling extension services to identify optimal flock sizes, management practices, and intervention targets to enhance agricultural productivity and empower smallholder farmers in Rwanda.\n",
